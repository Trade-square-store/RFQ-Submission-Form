4. Applies tiers:• Tier 1: 367 × 0.90 = 330.30 AED • Tier 2: 367 × 0.85 = 311.95 AED • Tier 3: 367 × 0.75 = 275.25 AED

A Catalog that works with your target audience
Creating an effective B2B eCommerce product catalog management for your e-commerce site that works with your target audience is something that needs to be thought about. Through large data sets and performing complex analytics companies tend to become more efficient as they are prepared for change and serve their customers better. 
Analytics will help you quantify and qualify the impact of your catalog by informing you of your design, market approach, speed, and inventory design. This way you can determine your scope of improvement and act likewise.
AI-Powered (Smart Conversational) Chatbots
AI-powered chatbots leverage artificial intelligence technologies like Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) to analyze user intent, context, and language variations. These AI bots can simulate real conversations and improve over time through machine learning.
Moreover, they can be trained on datasets, connected to product catalogs, CRMs, and knowledge bases, allowing them to give dynamic, personalized answers. Out and out, AI chatbots are suitable for mid to large ecommerce brands with global customers, product catalogs, and a need for real-time support.
Pros	Cons
Delivers a human-like, personalized experienceUnderstands complex or unstructured queriesHandles large volumes of queries with greater accuracyReduces the need for human intervention over time	Requires more time and data to train properlyHigher development and maintenance costMay need integration with multiple backend systems
3. Hybrid Chatbots
A hybrid chatbot follows a rule-based path when the user clicks buttons or selects predefined options. If the customer asks a more complex or open-ended question, the chatbot’s AI engine takes over to understand and respond contextually. Hybrid chatbot platforms are best for growing ecommerce brands that need personalized experiences while maintaining control over user flow and balancing automation with human support.
Pros	Cons
Offers flexibility and reliability in one solutionProvides guided flows for transactional tasksHandles complex queries with AI intelligenceReduces bounce rates and improves engagementMore scalable and future-ready than rule-based alone	More complex to build and configureNeed fine-tuning to balance rule-based and AI modes
Key Features Of Ecommerce Chatbots
As ecommerce becomes more competitive, offering personalized customer experiences through chatbots is a mandate these days. To drive conversions, support scalability, and improve customer experience, the chatbot tool must be equipped with key features. Here are some of them you need to take at: 
1. Personalized Product Suggestions
One of the most powerful ways to boost revenue is through personalized product recommendations. It can be done through integrating chatbots with your ecommerce store. By using customer browsing history, past purchases, and real-time behavior, your chatbot can recommend items that are most relevant to the shopper.
￼
For instance, if a customer just bought a smartphone, the chatbot can instantly suggest a compatible phone case, screen protector, or wireless earbuds. This allows ecommerce businesses to upsell or cross-sell effortlessly without relying on human agents.
Why Does It Matter?
✔️ Shortens the buyer journey✔️ Increases average order value (AOV)✔️ Feels personal and helpful
2. Real-Time Order Tracking
Order tracking is one of the most common questions customers ask as they want to know exactly where their package is and when it will be delivered. According to Verte Research, 19% of U.S. shoppers check their order status multiple times a day.
Instead of overloading with the customer service team, a chatbot can instantly provide real-time tracking updates directly within the chat interface. Whether the customer is looking for shipping times, delays, or delivery status, the chatbot pulls the latest data from the order management system.
Why Does It Matter?
✔️ Reduces ticket volume✔️ Enhances transparency and trust✔️ Improves customer satisfaction with instant responses
3. 24/7 Customer Support
An ecommerce chatbot should answer FAQs, resolve simple issues, and guide customers through actions like returns, exchanges, and cancellations 24/7. A well-trained bot can troubleshoot common problems using structured flows or AI-driven answers. And when an issue gets too complex, it should escalate to a live agent.
Why Does It Matter?
✔️ Keeps support running after hours✔️ Reduces wait times and increases customer loyalty✔️ Frees up live agents to handle high-priority cases
4. In-Chat Payment Processing
Whether it’s recommending a product or sending a cart reminder, enabling customers to pay without switching pages simplifies the journey and minimizes friction. Your chatbot should integrate with secure payment gateways to allow customers to complete purchases directly within the chat. If the payment fails, the bot should offer alternate payment options, keeping the customers active on the platform. 
Why Does It Matter?
✔️ Reduces cart abandonment✔️ Speeds up the path to purchase✔️ Delivers a true conversational commerce experience
5. Abandoned Cart Recovery
With a 69.99% average cart abandonment rate (says the Baymard Institute), the checkout process might be silently costing you more than an ad spend. It means only 3 in 10 customers complete checkout, showing how important it is to re-engage and convert abandoners through automation.
The best way is to make use of ecommerce bots that can automatically re-engage shoppers who left items in the cart. It can effectively be done through emails, or messaging platforms like WhatsApp or Facebook Messenger. Moreover, chatbots can personalize messages by showing abandoned items, offering discounts for different users.
